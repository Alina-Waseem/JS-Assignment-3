    <h2 >Exercise 3.1</h2>
    <p>1. Create an array to use as your shopping list with 3 items: "Milk," "Bread," and 
        "Apples."</p>
    <p> 2. Check your list length in the console.</p>
    <p> 3. Update "Bread" to "Bananas."</p>
    <p> 4. Output your entire list to the console.</p>
    <h2 >Exercise 3.2</h2>
    <p>1. Create an empty array to use as a shopping list.</p>
    <p>2. Add Milk, Bread, and Apples to your list.</p>
    <p>3. Update "Bread" with Bananas and Eggs.</p>
    <p>4. Remove the last item from the array and output it into the console.</p>
    <p>5. Sort the list alphabetically.</p>
    <p>6. Find and output the index value of Milk.</p>
    <p>7. After Bananas, add Carrots and Lettuce.</p>
    <p>8. Create a new list containing Juice and Pop.</p>
    <p>9. Combine both lists, adding the new list twice to the end of the first list.</p>
    <p>10. Get the last index value of Pop and output it to the console.</p>
    <h2 >Exercise 3.3</h2>
    <p>1. Create an array containing three values: 1, 2, and 3.</p>
    <p>2. Nest the original array into a new array three times.</p>
    <p>3. Output the value 2 from one of the arrays into the console.</p>
    <h2 >Exercise 3.4</h2>
    <p>1. Create a new myCar object for a car. Add some properties, including, but not 
        limited to, make and model, and values for a typical car or your car. Feel free 
        to use booleans, strings, or numbers.
        </p>
    <p>2. Create a variable that can hold the string value color. This variable 
        containing a string value color can now be used to reference the property 
        name within myCar. Then, use the variable within the square bracket notation 
        to assign a new value to the color property in myCar.</p>
    <p>3. Use that same variable and assign a new property string value to it, such as 
        forSale. Use the bracket notation once again to assign a new value to the 
        forSale property to indicate whether the car is available for purchase.</p>
    <p>4. Output make and model into the console.</p>
    <p>5. Output the value of forSale into the console.</p>
    <h2 >Exercise 3.5</h2>
    <p>1. Create an object named people that contains an empty array that is called 
    friends.</p>
    <p>2. Create three variables, each containing an object, that contain one of your 
    friend's first names, last names, and an ID value.</p>
    <p>3. Add the three friends to the friend array.</p>
    <p>4. Output it to the console.</p>
